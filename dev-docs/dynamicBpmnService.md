# DynamicBpmnService
>  [DynamicBpmnService](https://community.alfresco.com/community/bpm/blog/2017/06/01/activiti-6-is-here#comments) enables
changing properties/attributes (i.e. changing task assignee, task priority, service task class, script task script, etc!) of a process definition without the need to redeploy

- For the purpose of no need to redeploy the annotation,
  @leon proposed to apply the `DynamicBpmnService` to the annotation
